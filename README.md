# Dinosaur Database
## Author: Bailey JÃ¸rgensen
### Repository to showcase the mini database created for EDS 213 discussion section.

## Purpose: 

The mini database created for this discussion section will analyze dinosaur data from the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont California. This museum is an official repository that houses dinosaur speciments collected on United States government land by permit. The question that I will answer using this mini database is: what are the proportions of dinosaurs collected in this museum by formation? Or in other words, which formation is most represented in the collection.

## Data included:

Four main datasets are used in this analysis: 
1. Specimen data (regarding the individual specimens from the museum)
2. Locality data (location data for where each specimen is collected)
3. Accession data (data regarding how the specimen got to the collection, from donation or fieldwork)
4. Formation data (geological information, specifically about geologic units where fossils are found)

## Data access:

Data used for this project is data available upon request from the Collections Manager of the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont CA. Since the data involves sensitive information about specimen location data collected by permit from United States Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service land, it is not publically available online. The data provided for this exercise will have any coordinates redacted to two decimal points, as is the standard for protecting specimen sites.
